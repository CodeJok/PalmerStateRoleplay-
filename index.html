            <h2>Community Rules - Discord Rules - Game rules </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Respect All Players Be respectful and kind: Always treat other players with courtesy. Toxic behavior, harassment, or bullying will not be tolerated. No discrimination: Do not use offensive language or make remarks based on race, gender,
                    religion, sexuality, or any personal traits. Everyone deserves to feel welcome. Respect roleplay boundaries: Always respect the boundaries of others in terms of roleplay. If someone is uncomfortable with a situation, respect their
                    decision. Roleplay Realism Stay in character: Unless you‚Äôre in an OOC (Out of Character) chat, stay true to your character. Breaks from character (OOC chats) should be kept to a minimum. Realistic actions: Keep your actions within
                    the realms of realism. No superpowers or unrealistic abilities unless specified by game lore. Your character should behave in a way that makes sense within the world. No god-modding: Don‚Äôt control other players‚Äô actions or outcomes.
                    You can only control your own character, and you must get consent for any action that directly affects another player. No power-playing: You cannot make your character all-powerful or invincible. Everyone should have equal opportunities
                    for success or failure. No Meta-Gaming Avoid using out-of-character knowledge: Do not use information your character doesn‚Äôt know in-game. For example, if you know a player‚Äôs location because of OOC chat or outside sources, don‚Äôt use
                    that information in your roleplay. Stay in your character‚Äôs shoes: React and make decisions based on what your character knows, not what you know as a player. Fair Play and Avoiding Cheating No exploiting: Use of third-party software,
                    glitches, or hacks to gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited. Respect the game mechanics: Follow the rules of the game and don‚Äôt try to break or bypass them. No trolling: Purposefully disrupting roleplay for the sole intent
                    of causing chaos or getting a rise out of others is not allowed. Property and Vehicle Use Don‚Äôt abuse vehicles: Treat vehicles with respect. Don‚Äôt drive recklessly or block others. Always follow traffic rules in roleplay scenarios.
                    Respect others‚Äô property: If you're roleplaying with someone else‚Äôs vehicle or property, do so with their permission and respect their rights within the game. No Random Killings or Violence No Random Deathmatch (RDM): Don‚Äôt kill or
                    harm other players without a valid roleplay reason. Combat should make sense and be part of the ongoing story. Roleplay all engagements: If your character is going to engage in violence or criminal activities, there should be a roleplay
                    scenario that leads up to it. Don‚Äôt just randomly start attacking others. Avoid Spamming and Advertising No spam: Refrain from spamming chat with unnecessary messages or advertisements. No external ads: Don‚Äôt promote outside groups,
                    websites, or personal Roblox games unless allowed by the admins. Follow the Admin‚Äôs Decisions Obey moderators and admins: If an admin or moderator asks you to stop a behavior, follow their instructions. They are there to ensure a fair
                    and enjoyable experience for everyone. Disputes: If you have an issue with another player or moderator, calmly discuss the issue or file a report with a supervisor or admin. Do not engage in arguments or drama Respect the Server Environment
                    Keep the game immersive: Avoid distracting or out-of-place activities that break the immersion of the game. This includes excessively spamming emotes, unrelated jokes, or anything that draws attention away from the roleplay. No inappropriate
                    content: Do not use inappropriate language, images, or sounds in-game. This includes avatars, user names, and any text that could be offensive to other players</li>

                <h2> Discord Rules </h2>
                <li> 1) For topics regarding Racism, Sexism, and other forms of discrimination, there is a fine line between "joking", and trying to harm someone. Acknowledge where that line is, and do not cross it. 2) Please refrain from spamming links, images,
                    or GIF's in ‚Å†General, please use #media. 3) Don't pointlessly mention any of the staff. 4) Take any drama/beef with someone in PM's - To elaborate, if you can't refrain from bashing them or starting a fight, don't stoop to their level:
                    block them and ignore them. 5) Please DM one of the Admins for any problems that might arise regarding a member of the Staff. 6)NSFW Content (i.e Pornography) is not allowed. 7) Don't argue with the Staff, if you think your punishment
                    is unfair, please message one of the Admins , or myself directly. 8) Don't spam, or flood any of the chats. 9) If you would like to join our staff team, please goto ‚Å†‚Äïüö®Ô∏±becoming-staff 10) If you have something you would like us to
